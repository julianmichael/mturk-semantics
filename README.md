# mturk-semantics

Natural language semantics of the people, by the people, for the people.

## About

This is a project for gathering semantic annotations from the crowd on Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
Details on the project coming soon.

### Dependencies

To use this project,
you need [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
The rest of the dependencies are managed and will be downloaded for you.
Some of the most important components include the following:
 * [nlpdata](http://www.github.com/julianmichael/nlpdata) has data types, NLP datasets, and text rendering.
 * [spacro](http://www.github.com/julianmichael/spacro) is used to manage and run jobs on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
 * [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) is used for tokenization and POS-tagging.
 * [scalajs-react](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react) is used for the Turk client interfaces.

## Setup

After cloning this repo, run ```./scripts/setup.sh``` (you need `wget`)
and it should tell you what to do and download the necessary files.

In order to run some of the examples, you may need to download the
[Penn Treebank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc99t42) from the LDC---which requires a license---and
place it at `resources/ptb`.

In order to run any Mechanical Turk host, you will need to place a file called `mturk.properties`
in the base directory containing your AWS credentials for MTurk (See `scripts/setup.sh`),
and you will need your SSL certs/keystore in the `resources` folder of your project
(ask me for details on this part) in order for it to work on MTurk.

## Usage

Assuming all of the setup is done, you can run an example annotation pipeline by executing `scripts/run.sh <project>`
(e.g., `scripts/run.sh scisrl`).
This will open up the sbt console and start the webserver.
At this point entering `exp.start` on the console will cause it to begin uploading HITs.
However, by default the task will point at `localhost` for JS files, which means you won't be able to test it on MTurk,
but you will be able to view the interface at `localhost:8888?taskKey=generation`.
Change the value of `domain` in `scripts/init-<project>.scala` to set the appropriate domain name where Turk can reach your server;
then you should be able to view and do example HITs on the sandbox.
To go to production, change the value of `isProduction` to `true` in `scripts/init-<project>.scala`.
